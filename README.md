# Weather-App
This weather app is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specified city. The user can input a city name in the provided text field and click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve real-time weather information. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data such as temperature, humidity, and weather description based on the user's input.

The UI is clean and user-friendly, featuring a form with an input field for the city name and a submit button. Upon submitting the form, the app asynchronously fetches weather data using the fetch API and displays the information on a styled card. The card includes details such as the city name, temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, humidity percentage, weather description, and an emoji representing the current weather conditions.

The app also incorporates a function to display appropriate weather emojis based on the weather ID obtained from the API response. Additionally, error handling is implemented to inform the user in case of input errors or if the weather data cannot be fetched successfully.

The styling is well-designed, with a responsive layout, vibrant colors, and clear typography. The app provides an engaging and visually appealing way for users to quickly obtain weather information for a chosen city.
